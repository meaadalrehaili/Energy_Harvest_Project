# Energy_Harvest_Project
Multiphase flow in porous media governs the recovery of subsurface energy including hydrocarbon and geothermal, and their management usually requires intensive simulation runs to quantify subsurface uncertainties and optimize engineering operations, which are often expensive. In this project, we ask you to develop machine-learning-based surrogate models to predict the oil production in a water-flooding reservoir. The data was generated from 1000 simulation runs with parameterizing rock properties and well controlling schedule, and our goal is to use these attributes to infer the ultimate oil production after 10 years and also the yearly oil production.
